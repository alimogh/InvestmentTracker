    <string name="spot_trading">Spot trading is the process of buying and selling digital assets such
            as Bitcoin and Ethereum for immediate delivery. In other words, cryptocurrencies are directly
            transferred between market participants (buyers and sellers). In a spot market, you have
            direct ownership of cryptocurrencies and are entitled to legal rights such as voting for
            major forks or staking participation.</string>

    <string name="Margin_trading">Margin trading is a method of trading assets using funds provided
            by a third party. When compared to regular trading accounts, margin accounts allow traders
            to access greater sums of capital, allowing them to leverage their positions.
            Essentially, margin trading amplifies trading results so that traders are able to realize larger
            profits on successful trades. For example, to open a $100,000 trade at a leverage of 10:1,
            a trader would need to commit $10,000 of their capital.</string>
